        <p class="sectionSubTag text-smalls">Education in Pakistan faces various challenges including insufficient funding, lack of quality teachers, and inadequate infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Despite government initiatives to promote education, such as the Right to Education Act, disparities persist, with significant differences in access and quality between urban and rural areas, as well as among different socio-economic groups. Additionally, gender disparity remains a concern, with lower enrollment and higher dropout rates among girls compared to boys. Efforts to improve education include increasing investment, enhancing teacher training programs, and promoting girls' education through incentives and awareness campaigns. Addressing these challenges is crucial for Pakistan to achieve its educational goals and socioeconomic development.</p>
